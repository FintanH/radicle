## Built-in datatypes

`radicle` supports the following datatypes:

### Booleans

The literal syntax for booleans is `#t` for true, and `#f` for false.

### Strings

### Lists

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries are mappings between keys and values. (You may know them as maps,
associative arrays, or symbol tables.)
